        As AI foundation model development rapidly expands, welcoming new contributors, scientists, and
        applications, we hope to help new community members become familiar with the latest resources, tools, and growing
        body of research findings. The focus of this cheatsheet is not only to support building, but also to inculcate good
        practices, awareness of limitations, and general responsible habits as community norms.""")

        There are many exceedingly popular tools to build, distribute and deploy foundation models. But there
        are also many incredible resources that have gone less noticed, in the community's efforts to accelerate, deploy, and
        monetize. We hope to bring wider attention to these core resources that support informed data selection, processing,
        and understanding, precise and limitation-aware artifact documentation, resource-frugal model
        training, advance awareness of the environmental impact from training, careful model evaluation
        and claims, and lastly, responsible model release and deployment practices.

        We've compiled strong resources, tools, and papers that have helped
        guide our own intuitions around model development, and which we believe will be especially helpful to nascent
        (and sometimes even experienced) developers in the field. However, this guide is certainly not comprehensive or
        perfectâ€”and here's what to consider when using it:
        * They are scoped to 'open' model development, by which we mean the model weights will be publicly downloadable.
        * Foundation model development is a rapidly evolving science. This cheatsheet is dated to December 2023, but
        our repository is open for on-going public contributions: www.comingsoon.com.
        * We've scoped our content modalities only to text, vision, and speech. We attempt to support multilingual
        resources, but acknowledge these are only a starting point.
        * A cheatsheet cannot be comprehensive. We rely heavily on survey papers and repositories to point out the
        many other awesome works which deserve consideration, especially for developers who plan to dive deeper
        into a topic.
        * Lastly, we do not recommend all these resources for all circumstances, and have provided notes throughout
        to guide this judgement. Instead we hope to bring awareness to good practices that many developers neglect
        in the haste of development (eg careful data decontamination, documentation, and carefully specifying the
        intended downstream uses).
